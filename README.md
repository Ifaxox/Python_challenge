# Python_challenge
Python_Challenge_3
For this assignment, i had to build two Python scripts, one for a 'financial data analysis' task named PyBank and another for an 'electoral data analysis' task named PyPoll. I found this task quiet difficult, but i tried my best with it using online resources and just trail and error running my code. In the PyBank task, I counted the months, calculated the total "Profit/Losses", their changes, and aswell as the greatest increase and decreases. For the PyPoll task, I tallied the number of votes, listed candidates, calculated vote percentages for each winner, and defined also the winner. I've uploaded my results as a text file, scripts, and other relevant files.
